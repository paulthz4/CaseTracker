## Summary
Desktop application developed to track tasks using JavaFX. This application is meant to aid productivity and help with time management. To gain insight on the data stored, visit https://github.com/paulthz4/TaskTrackerWeb.
Tasks are stored in MongoDB.
You can create as many cases as you want with no dupilcates. Each case records its date and time when it was created, as well as the time it has been worked on and is added the list of cases in the top panel. The "Summary" button provides a summary of all the cases and displays it in the left panel. Scroll to the bottom to see the total time you've been working. The 'Remove Task' button only removes the task from the list shown in the list view not from MongoDB. The 'Delete Task' button removes the task from the list view and from MongoDB.
