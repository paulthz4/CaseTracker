Java application using JavaFX library to track tasks (cases).

You can create as many cases as you want with no dupilcates. Each case records its date and time when it was created, as well as the time it has been worked on. The "Summary" button provides a summary of all the cases and displays it in the textarea. Scroll to the bottom to see the total time you've been working.
